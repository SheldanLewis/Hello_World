# Hello_World
My first Rep

My name is Sheldan, and am currently studying data science with Flatiron School! I hold a bachelor's degree in finance from Chapman Univerity. I love to read all things pertaining to philosophy, art, math, and business. And consider myself a student of the world... in other words, I let my curiousity guide me; as of now, it has led me to pursue my passion of working with data!
